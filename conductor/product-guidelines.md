# Product Guidelines

## Visual Design and User Experience (UX)

The "combustiveis" application should aim for a **Modern & Minimalist** visual design and user experience. This approach will feature clean lines, a simple color palette, and intuitive navigation, making the application broadly appealing and easy to use for fuel station owners/managers. The focus will be on clarity and efficiency, ensuring that users can quickly understand and interact with the application's core functionalities without unnecessary visual clutter.
